        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>
            NLP-TAB is a web-based system designed to allow researchers and developers of Natural Language Processing
            (NLP) systems to compare the output of several disparate NLP systems to each other or to a manually created
            reference standard. The comparison is performed by running the NLP systems on a single corpus of text with
            subsequent statistical analysis of co-occurences between annotations generated by NLP systems. Analysis
            results are stored and indexed using the Elasticsearch technology and displayed to end users with a custom
            web-based interface. NLP-TAB operates in two modes: Annotation Analysis and Type System Analysis as
            described below. The system is still early in its development - new features and improvements will be added
            in the course of next several months, so you don't find what you need right now, please check back later.

        <h4>Documents</h4>
        <p>
            The Documents section allows for the exploration of the documents run through each of the analyzed systems.
            You can filter to find specific text in documents, below are a few examples:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
            When exploring the documents you can select ranges of text in order to see which systems annotate the text
            with which types. You can select types to see their instances.
        </p>
        <h4>Type System Analysis</h4>

        <p>
            Type system analysis performs the comparison between annotation types generated by the different NLP systems
            by first counting how often pairs of annotations from different NLP systems cover approximately the same
            text and how often they cover completely different text. This co-occurence information is used to generate
            2X2 tables for all pairs of annotation types in order to calculate the degree of dependence between
            annotation types using common metrics which at present include the F-score, Jaccard and Matthews
            coefficients. Pairs of annotation types with higher scores are more likely to be functionally equivalent.
        </p>

        <h4>Type Systems</h4>

        <p>
            The type systems screen allows for users to explore the type systems that have been uploaded to the system,
            browsing the individual types in each system. Information included on the type systems page:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic information about types, their super and subtypes, and their occurrences</li>
            <li>Primitive features, their common values and distribution breakdowns</li>
            <li>Reference features, and what types they link to</li>
            <li>Instances of specific types</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Elasticsearch Backend</h4>

        <p>
            NLP-TAB uses an Elasticsearch backend to store Common Annotation Structure (CAS) information produced by
            each NLP system being compared for each document in the collection. A read-only api to the backend is
            accessible at <a href="/elasticsearch">athena.ahc.umn.edu/elasticsearch</a>. For more information on
            elasticsearch, you can visit their website at <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">elasticsearch.org</a>.
        </p>
